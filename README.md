# HTML Assignment🌐

## Overview 📝

This HTML project consists of a simple website layout with four main sections: **Home**, **Gallery**, **Story**, and a **Login Form**. The assignment is designed to practice basic HTML structure, linking pages, creating forms, and adding multimedia elements. 

The website is built using pure HTML and minimal styling. It includes navigation between different sections and basic form functionality. 🚀
